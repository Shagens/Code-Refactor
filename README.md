## Code Refactor

## User Story

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines


## Markup

I've revised my code with semantic structure to clearly define its content. I also icluded
attributes to images to show text just in case the viewer is unable to see the image. I added the 
title that was already given in the header.
